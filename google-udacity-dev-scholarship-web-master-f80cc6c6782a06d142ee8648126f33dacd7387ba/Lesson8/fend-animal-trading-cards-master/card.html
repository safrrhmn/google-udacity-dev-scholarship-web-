			<p>The Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris) is the most numerous tiger subspecies in Asia, and was estimated at fewer than
				2,500 individuals by 2011. Since 2008, it is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List and is threatened by poaching,
				loss and fragmentation of habitat. None of the Tiger Conservation Landscapes within its range is considered large enough
				to support an effective population of more than 250 adult individuals.(source wikipedia)</p>
