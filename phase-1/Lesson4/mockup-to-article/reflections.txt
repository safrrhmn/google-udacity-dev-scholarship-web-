1. It has been particularly amazing. I have learned a few things that I did not learn before from this course. Usage of <del>, <sup> and <hr> tags were amazing and it is interesting to know how much difference these can make.
2. I would not say it was very easy. I needed to do some research and learn about new tags. I also found that <strike> tag is absolute according to https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/strike and I used <del> instead to strikeout the deleted statement. So, I have learned new things after doing the research.
3. Nothing so far. I just had to look up things and adjust my HTML accordingly.
4. There are few things I followed specifically to make sure the problem I face can be solved correctly.
  a. I made sure I have used the tags I have learned from previous lessons and from feedback forum.
  b. I have put my HTML on Chrome in order to make sure that it looks like the mockup
  c. I have researched MDN websites about the new tags that I needed. 
  d. Made sure to use the HTML validator to validate my code
